# Introduction

**React Kit** ([@js-smart/react-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@js-smart/react-kit)) is a comprehensive collection of reusable React components and utilities built with MUI (Material UI) and React Router.

The library provides UI components (buttons, dialogs, snack bars, links, progress, tables, etc.) and utility functions for dates, strings, HTTP clients, state management, and other common tasks. Use React Kit to build React applications with a flexible, type-safe, and well-documented set of building blocks.

## Technologies

- **React** (18.3+ or 19.x)
- **MUI** (Material UI) for components and theming
- **React Router** for navigation

## What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 22.0 or above (LTS recommended).
- A React project (e.g. Vite, Next.js, or Create React App). React Kit supports **React 18.3+** or later.

To install the library, see [Installation](/docs/introduction/installation).
