# Copilot Instructions for the Codebase

## Overview

- **React Kit** is a React/TypeScript library
- The app uses Vite for build/dev, Playwright for E2E tests, and Vitest for unit tests. State management is via Jotai, data fetching with React Query, and UI with MUI

## React & TypeScript Best Practices

1. Always use the latest React 19 version and TypeScript for ReactJS development. Reference the latest React docs at https://react.dev/learn.
2. Use React Router and the latest MUI components for all routing and UI needs.
3. Write only functional components and use React hooks for all state management.
4. Use TypeScript for type safety in all React components and logic.
5. Apply the latest React performance optimizations (e.g., memoization, lazy loading, code splitting).
6. Ensure all components meet accessibility (a11y) standards.
7. Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting. Follow project configs.
8. Add clear, concise comments to explain complex logic or important decisions.
9. Define component props using TypeScript interfaces (preferred) or PropTypes.
10. Design components to be reusable and modular, following DRY principles.
